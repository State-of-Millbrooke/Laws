## HELLO THERE!

#### Hello there!

1. You probably got here from clicking on a hyperlink from the [Millbrooke State Laws sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rFUN85lp2QD3nl1_Bs-l00PG87AH_2GFeeC0Vf0NHYo/edit?gid=1554113459#gid=1554113459). 

#### Public Laws

2. Every file (like this one) that appears in the [Public Laws folder](https://github.com/State-of-Millbrooke/Laws/tree/main/Public%20Laws) means the law has been enacted, **not that it is currently in force** - it may have since been amended or repealed. If any changes have been made, there will be a note like this at the very top:

> [!NOTE]  
> Amended by _. See [Consolidation](https://github.com/State-of-Millbrooke/Laws/tree/main/Consolidations).

## WHAT'S ALL THIS STUFF ON THE HEADER

#### Assembly of Millbrooke

3. We only have one house: the Assembly. But this is necessary to identify what authority the legislation is enacted under in the case of [regulations](https://github.com/State-of-Millbrooke/Laws/tree/main/Regulations) and [executive orders](https://github.com/State-of-Millbrooke/Laws/tree/main/Executive%20Orders). 

#### Explanation Act

4. Title of the law, regulation, executive order, etc.

#### Chapter 1, Statutes of Millbrooke

5. This is for citation purposes:

|Chapter|Cite as|Example citation|Example citation (with section)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Chapter 1, Statutes of Millbrooke|S-1|*Explanation Act*, S-1|*Explanation Act*, S-1, s. 5|
|Chapter 1, Regulations of Millbrooke|R-1|*Electoral Regulations*, R-1|*Electoral Regulations*, R-1, s. 6(1)|
|Chapter 25, Executive Orders|E-25|*Order granting pardon to Bob*, E-25|*Order granting pardon to Bob*, E-25, s. 1(3)(b)|

6. Note: The chapter numbers are assigned by the devs have nothing to do with bill numbers used by the Assembly.

#### Enacted date

7. The enacted date is **when the bill became law**.

-  If the Governor approved the bill ("signed the bill"), the enacted date is the date on which the Governor signed.
-  If the Governor has not objected to the bill within 72 hours after the Assembly adopted the bill, the bill also becomes law. In that case the enacted date would be the third calendar day *after* the date on which the Assembly adopted the bill.

8. Note: If the Governor objected to the bill and the bill does not become law, it will not show up in this folder.
